# Regression_Model_to_Predict_Cement_Compressive_Strength

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Linear Regression model to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its ingredients and the age of the concrete. Compressive strength is a crucial property of concrete, reflecting its ability to withstand compressive forces. Accurate prediction of compressive strength is essential in the construction industry for ensuring the safety and durability of structures.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of samples with the following features:

- **Cement (kg/m³)**: The amount of cement in the concrete mix.
- **Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m³)**: The amount of blast furnace slag in the concrete mix.
- **Fly Ash (kg/m³)**: The amount of fly ash in the concrete mix.
- **Water (kg/m³)**: The amount of water in the concrete mix.
- **Superplasticizer (kg/m³)**: The amount of superplasticizer in the concrete mix.
- **Coarse Aggregate (kg/m³)**: The amount of coarse aggregate in the concrete mix.
- **Fine Aggregate (kg/m³)**: The amount of fine aggregate in the concrete mix.
- **Age (days)**: The age of the concrete sample in days.
- **Compressive Strength (MPa)**: The target variable representing the compressive strength of the concrete.
